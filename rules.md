### Characters who introduce additional sides to the conflict:
* Cupid: Wins with the village. In the first night, chooses two other players or another player and oneself, henceforth lovers. The lovers know each other as such but might not know each other's cards or who Cupid is. If one lover dies, so does the other lover. If and only if one lover belongs to the village while the other lover belongs to the pack, the lovers become their own team.
* Pied Piper: Wins alone. Chooses two new players each night to put under a charm and wins when all other players are charmed. Charmed players know each other as such but do not know the pied piper. They are not yet on the pied piper's side.

* Bigot: Wins alone when all players of a certain group (women, redheads, lefties...) chosen by the game master have been eliminated.
* Angel: Wins alone if killed during the first night (or day if you start lynching right away).

### Characters whose death bring about special effects:
